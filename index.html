			<div id="main">
				<p><font size="6">Anathema</font> is an English progressive rock band from Liverpool. They were
					primarily known as one of the pioneering and leading death doom metal acts,
					incorporating growling, poetic lyrics and complex arrangements into the
					traditional doom riffage. Later in their career, beginning with "Eternity",
					they moved away from this sound into more melodic, atmospheric rock.  The
					line-up consists of singers and guitarists Vincent and Daniel Cavanagh, their
					brother Jamie Cavanagh at bass, siblings John and Lee Douglas, respectively
					drummer and singer, and keyboardist Daniel Cardoso since November 2012.</p>
				<p>Being the most underrated band of the 1990's can be hard to take.
					For a start, nobody knows you're underrated because you're underrated. This,
					sometimes, is the affliction of the talented. Without sounding unbelievably
					egotistical, this is the burden of ANATHEMA. Born, bred, raised and emblazoned
					with true Liverpudlian style, these four friends (two brothers) and like-minded
					individuals are proud of their legendary beginnings, although it can be
					unfairly judgmental coming from the home town of The Beatles, Cilla Black, the
					Cavern Club, Melanie Chisolm and current trendsetters Shack. However, in June
					1999 ANATHEMA released their fifth full length studio album 'Judgement', an
					album which, for many, was the genre defining rock album of the decade!
					Recorded at Damage Inc. Studios in Ventimiglia, Italy in February 1999 with Kit
					Woolven (Thin Lizzy, Cradle Of Filth) as producer, ANATHEMA took 3 months to
					record their masterpiece. News that this album was going to be something very
					special escaped before the album was even finished. Concerts in Italy, during
					the recording process, only hinted at what was to come.</p>

				<p>'Judgement' finally emerged on 21st June 1999 to critical and fan
					acclaim, many calling it spiritual and inspiring, with the band making 'Album
					Of The Month' in over 20 magazines worldwide. Anyone who calls themselves a fan
					of rock music now cites ANATHEMA as a band at the forefront of the genre.</p>

				<p>When the trio, Vinnie, Danny and Jamie Cavanagh, were larking
					about with an old, and no doubt broken, acoustic guitar or two, few would have
					imagined that it could amount to anything. But just a year later their first
					demo was complete. 'An Iliad Of Woes' started to circulate around the
					underground in 1990. Even at that early stage people spoke of them as being
					good and promising, but who could predict how much they would achieve. </p>
				<p>Anathema have reached some of their goals by doing what every musician
					should be able to achieve, to write good music. It's only a matter of time
					before ANATHEMA start the world stadium tour they so rightly deserve to do.</p>

								<p>Jamie is the twin brother of <a href="#vini">Vincent Cavanagh</a> and the younger brother of <a href="#danny">Danny Cavanagh</a>. </p>
								<p>While Paradise Lost and My Dying Bride got more attention
									from underground doom metal fans, Liverpool natives Anathema were just as
									important in creating a new strain of doom (sometimes referred to as
									doom/death) that drew heavily from atmospheric goth metal and, in the early
									days, featured gruff death-style vocals. Guitar-playing brothers Vincent and
									Danny Cavanagh formed Anathema in 1990 with vocalist Darren White, bassist
									Duncan Patterson, and drummer John Douglas, and originally called themselves
									Pagan Angel. As Anathema, the band recorded a Black Sabbath/Paradise
									Lost-inspired demo titled An Iliad of Woes; another demo, 1991's All Faith Is
									Lost, and a Swiss single called "They Die" landed the group a deal with
									Peaceville Records. Anathema's first official recording, an EP titled The
									Crestfallen, was released in 1992, and followed the next year by the
									full-length Serenades, the most traditional doom-styled album in their
									catalog.</p>
								<p>After a tour, the group reentered the studio in 1994 to
									record Pentecost III, a five-song mini-album that nonetheless ended up long
									enough to have qualified as a full-length. Delays prevented its release until
									the following year, by which time the group was already working on its next
									album. However, after recording had begun, Darren White left the group to form
									the Blood Divine, taking with him their sound's main connection to death metal.
									Vincent Cavanagh assumed lead vocal duties, with a cleaner, more accessible
									style that fit the newly atmospheric direction of the finished album.</p>

							<p>Real/full name: John James Douglas </p>
							<p>Age: 43 (born Jul 11th, 1972) </p>
							<p>Place of origin: United Kingdom (Liverpool) </p>
							<p>Gender: Male</p>
							<p>John is the elder brother of <a href="#le">Lee Douglas</a>. </p>

							<p>The Silent Enigma was released in late 1995, and began to
								establish Anathema as a unique presence on the underground doom scene. That
								impression was confirmed by their next release, 1996's heavily gothic Eternity,
								which featured contributions from Cradle of Filth keyboardist Les Smith.
								Stretching its songs into sorrowful, orchestrated epics, Eternity's Pink
								Floyd-ish spaciness alienated some fans of Anathema's older sound at first, but
								quickly proved to be their most original work to date. Drummer Douglas left the
								group in late 1997, and ex-Solstice drummer Shaun Steels joined the following
								year. Alternative 4 was released in the summer of 1998, taking a simpler,
								subtler, and more polished approach than its predecessor; shortly afterward,
								bassist Patterson left and was replaced by Dave Pybus. In 1999, original
								drummer John Douglas rejoined, and the group switched to the Music for Nations
								label. The well-received Judgement album was issued later that year, marking a
								complete departure from metal, though the themes in their songs remained gloomy
								while taking on an air of existential despair. Later in the year, keyboardist
								Martin Powell and Cradle of Filth's keyboardist Les Smith traded bands; Smith
								became an integral part of Anathema's sound.</p> <p>The band underwent more
								changes as the new century began. Just before the release of 2001's A Fine Day
								to Exit, studio bassist Pybus left to join Cradle of Filth as well. He was
								replaced by touring bassist George Roberts and later by Jamie Cavanagh. Danny
								Cavanagh left the band for a year in 2002, but returned for 2003's deeply
								atmospheric, nearly prog rock A Natural Disaster. Music for Nations closed
								after its distributor's acquisition by Sony/BMG, and Anathema found itself
								without a label. They continued to tour and release tracks on their website via
								the "pay-what-you-think-it's-worth" model established by Radiohead. They
								eventually signed to the Snapper subsidiary KScope, and issued a collection of
								acoustic re-recordings of catalog items titled Hindsight. It was followed in
								2010 by We're Here Because We're Here and Falling Deeper in 2011. The band's
								ninth album, Weather Systems, was recorded in Liverpool, North Wales, and Oslo.
								It was produced by the Cavanagh brothers and Norway's Christer-André Cederberg,
								and released in 2012.</p>
							<p>After a lengthy tour, Anathema took a short break before
								getting back down to work, eager to chart the new direction the band was
								finding live. Sessions with Cederberg took place and a new album, Distant
								Satellites, emerged. Mixed by Cederberg and Steven Wilson, the set was released
								in June of 2014. A live album, A Sort of Homecoming, featuring the group's
								performance at Liverpool Cathedral, followed in 2015. </p>

								<p>(born 28 March 1981) is a multi-instrumentalist, song writer
									and producer. He was born in the south of Portugal, and is currently a member
									of British band Anathema. Daniel was also in Head Control System with
									Kristoffer Rygg and Leafblade with Danny Cavanagh.</p>
								<p>First known as the drummer in the band SiriuS, and with whom he released two
									records through the Norwegian label Nocturnal Art Productions (property of
									Tomas "Samoth" Haugen). In addition to his drumming, Daniel was responsible for
									all the orchestral compositions, synth performance, most of the bass guitar
									recordings as well as co-producing both albums. His experiences in SiriuS has
									helped Daniel develop a multi-angled perception of music creation. When SiriuS
									later nailed down a record deal with Nuclear Blast he decided to move on,
									because, as he said, "it just wasn't funny anymore".[citation needed] He then
									conceived and commenced working on SinDRomE, i.e. Severe Damage on Reason and
									Equilibrium, his musical "means" to manipulate minds via sound, that would
									later become Head Control System.</p> <p>Daniel presently has an extensive
									curriculum as both producer and/or session
									musician for a vast list of bands: Anneke van Giersbergen, Head Control System,
									Ava Inferi, Angelus Apatrida, Heavenwood, Ramp (live), Anathema (live), Vertigo
									Steps, W.A.K.O., and many more. Furthermore, he was invited by the band
									Re:aktor (signed on Nuclear Blast) to join their flanks - which he did for a
									while - featuring on their debut record's single video and joining them on
									their European tour supporting US band Exodus as a drummer.</p> <p>One of his
									most acclaimed outcomes is the work with Kristoffer Rygg on
									Murder Nature, Head Control System's debut album, released worldwide by The End
									Records (US) and VME (Europe). He also recently started developing his solo
									efforts as Del, although things are not clear whether this is a serious
									project or not.</p> <p>During late 2010, Daniel started producing and
									co-writing Dutch artist
									Anneke van Giersbergen's fourth studio album "Everything is Changing". The
									new single "Feel Alive" came out on YouTube on September 2011 and the album is
									expected to come out on early 2012.</p> <p>Daniel also owns the brand
									UltraSoundStudios, a franchised company that has
									two recording studios operating in Portugal, one in Braga, in northern Portugal
									and the other one in Moita, southern Portugal. He currently splits his
									production jobs across both studios.</p>

								<p>Real/full name: Lee Helen Douglas </p>
								<p>Age: 40 (born Oct 10th, 1975) </p>
								<p>Place of origin: United Kingdom (Liverpool, England) </p>
								<p>Gender: Female</p>
								<p>Lee is the younger sister of <a href="#jon">John Douglas</a>. </p>

								<p>Shortly before the release of A Fine Day to Exit, Dave Pybus announced his departure from the band and later joined Cradle of Filth. He was replaced by touring bassist George Roberts, and later by Jamie Cavanagh.</p>
								<p>In March 2002, Daniel Cavanagh announced his departure from the band, joining Duncan Patterson's band Antimatter. However, he later rejoined Anathema in 2003 for the release of A Natural Disaster, and started their European tour. This accelerated the changes in Anathema's tone, towards the atmospheric and progressive, as exhibited in album tracks "Flying" and "Violence".</p>
								<p>Upon the closing of their label Music for Nations after its purchase by Sony BMG, Anathema found itself without a record label, despite having completed an extensive tour of the UK with popular Finnish rock band HIM in April 2006. During their search for a new label, the band have adopted a more 'DIY' approach to music release, embracing the internet and releasing songs via their own website, for which fans may donate a monetary sum of their own choice. Despite the obvious lack of label-based tour support, the band continues to play dates across Europe, guitarist Danny Cavanagh also playing the odd low-key acoustic concert.</p>
